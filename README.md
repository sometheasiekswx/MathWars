### Description

MathWars is an beautifully designed educational web app perfect for future Mathematicians, Computer Scientists, and Engineers! The MathWars project was started because of a unit course at Deakin College (SIT120), it was designed to teach kids and teens that Math can be fun and engaging. Students will be able to practice solving the many problems in Mathematics ranging from easy to mind-boggling.

### Features

- Mathematics: There were many Mathematics-related mini-games to play in this section.
- Multiple Choices: There will be 4 multiple choices to select from when answering a question, 1 of which is the correct answer. 
- Algebra: There will be ALgebra-related questions in this section.
- Trigonometry: There will be Trigonometry-related questions in this section.
- Calculus: There will be Calculus-related questions in this section.
- Flashmath: A time-based game where you have to answer an infinite amount of Arithmetic questions. It gets harder, of course, and the more you answer, the more scores you will gain. If a question is answered wrong, scores will decrease and the questions will become easier. The timer resets for every question and when it runs out, its game over.
- Light Mode (Defualt): The defualt color mode of MathWars that is seemless and pretty.
- Dark Mode: The second color mode of the entire app that saves battery and expresses confident. 

### The future

This online platform aims to be community driven, which means that anyone can set up their own questions with answers that others can try to solve and gain points from. There are groups that the users can join to solve large problems together to each earn more points than usual. The skills taught in MathWars will be very useful in many different fields that involve complex problem solving.

The Computer Science part of MathWars will have heavily inspired by [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/). As for the Engineering part, [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/) will have a major influence.
